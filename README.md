## AWS Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account with SES access
2. Verified sender email address or domain in SES
3. IAM user with SES permissions

### Required IAM Permissions

Your IAM user needs the following permissions. You can either use the AWS managed policy `AmazonSESSendingAccess` or create a custom policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ses:SendEmail",
                "ses:SendRawEmail"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Important**: If you're getting authorization errors, ensure:
1. Your IAM user has the correct permissions (check IAM console)
2. The sending email address is verified in SES
3. You're using the correct AWS region where your email is verified
4. If in SES sandbox mode, recipient emails must also be verified

### Plugin Configuration

2. Go to Settings > Fullworks SES
3. Enter your AWS credentials:
   - Access Key ID
